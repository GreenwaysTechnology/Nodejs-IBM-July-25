What is npm?
 npm is the world's largest software registry.
 open source developers from every part of the world use npm to share and borrow packages.
 many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

In js, you might have created lib/framework/utility, if you want to share to other developers in the world or within your organization or your team - npm helps.

NPM consists of three components

1.the website - used to discover packages, setup profiles and manage other aspects of npm
2.CLI runs from the terminal, and how most developers interact with npm.
3.registry - it is  large public database of js software and the meta information surrounding it.

core concepts in npm:

1.package
2.module

What is package?
   A package is a file or directory that is described by a "package.json" file
   A package must contain package.json file in order to be published to the npm  registry

Package format:
a.A folder containing a program described by a package.json.
b.A gizpped tarball containing "a"
c.A URL that resolves "a"

Modules:
 A module is any file or directory in the "node_modules" directory or locally that can be loaded by the node.js require function

 A javascript file

modules need not have "package.json" file

eg:
 const http =require('http')

 here the variable called http refers the 'http' module.

				How to create npm package

Steps:

1.create folder
>mkdir mynpm-apps
>cd mynpm-apps
>mkdir src

2.create package.json

Before create you have to ensure that npm has been installed.

npm init <initalizer>

npm init
npm init --yes

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.


package.json

{
  "name": "mynpmapps",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is demo package",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "my",
    "demo",
    "package"
  ],
  "author": "Subramanian Murugan",
  "license": "ISC"
}

name:
 This is used to publish package into registry

version:
   if you publish package into registry, which is differentiated by "version"

"1.0.0" - version no is based on the concept called "SEM Ver" concept- Semantic versioning.
 Major.minor.patch
 
 "^1.2.3" -  compatible with 1.x.x
"~1.2.3"  - Only patch updates allowed
"1.2.3"   - Exact version

main:
  It is main file used /entry file in the package , generally it would index.js or main.js

description:
  It explains the nature of packages- what is this packge.

Keywords:
  Used to discover your packages using npm search command

author:
  Who is author of this package

license:
  You should specify a license for your package so that people know how they are permitted to use it.

				Node Packages

How to install node packages which was distributed by others?

npm install [<package-name>]

You can find out the packages from npm registry server

npm install | i  lodash --options

npm i lodash 

No options are given by default "--save"

Options:

 --save
     for production + dev
 --save-dev
     -for only for dev 
 --production
    -for only production
  -g
    -for tool purpose -dev


Application mode

1.dev
2.test
3.prod

dev : any dependency required for development only
  --save-dev
test : 
   any dependency required for development only - test
   --save-dev
prod:
  dependency used in dev and production... 
  --save
"dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
..................................................................................
			 Test /Dev Only Dependency
.................................................................................

Libs required for dev and test
tools
   -compilers, webservers
   -testing libs and frameworks 

eg:
  mocha - test runner is used for running test case
  chai.js -test assertion lib used for writing test cases
  jest -  test runner is used for running test cases

 "devDependencies": {
    "chai": "^4.3.6"
  }

	  How to install only production dependencies during build process
....................................................................................
if you want to use app in production mode, you have exclude the dependencies.

npm i /npm install - install dev and production packages...
 --->it scans package.json file which install everything(dev + prod)

npm install --production or npm i --omit=dev
  it scans package.json which install only from  production dependencies

			How to remove /uninstall package

npm uninstall mocha --save-dev
,,,,,,,,,,,,,........................................................................
			Global Packages
..................................................................................
         		

Global package is installed not inside project, installed globally.
Global packages are generally tools to create projects,webservers,test runtime like so.


npm install nodemon -g
npm install mocha -g
npm install create-react-app -g


etc...
....................................................................................
			 scripts
....................................................................................
 if you want to automat the js app workflows, scripts section is used.

scripts has ,script command and task to be executed.

  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },

test - is command
"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" - task to be executed

in npm we have many built in commands.
eg
 start
 stop
 publish
 test
 pack
 postinstall
 preinstall
etc..
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts#npm-rebuild

Use case :
 We can run node apps using scripts
 we can run webservers using scripts
 we can initialize the test env using scripts
 we can start containers using scripts
 etc...

how to execute scripts commands?

npm commandName
eg
npm start
npm test
npm pack
etc..

npm allows even custom commands

subu:"task"
build:""
deploy:""
compile:""

if you want to custom script command?

npm run commandName
npm run subu
npm run build
.....................................................................................
			Global Modules and scripts
.....................................................................................

Tools we have installed globally like nodemon.

In order to avoid version mismatch, we can install any tools(webservers,compilers,utilites) as local module.

npm install nodemon -save-dev

After installing,nodemon is not available to execute like 

nodemon src/index.js
Error:
nodemon' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

How to run nodemon?
 via scripts.
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "nodemon src/index.js",
    "build": "node src/index.js"
  },

Tools to manage node packages

1.npm
2.npx -  Node package execute
3.yarn
4.pnpm -  Fast, disk-efficient alternative to npm

.....................................................................................
			 npx command
.....................................................................................

npx is a commandline tool that comes with node.js(since version) and is used to

1.Run node packages without installing them globally
2.Execute cli tools that are installed in your project
3.Quickly test packages or tools from the npm registry

eg:
>npx cowsay "Hello from npx"
 ________________
< Hello from npx >
 ----------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

npm vs npx
npm installs packages
npx executes the packages

npm takes some diskspace, npx never takes any diskspace
